##### More on the Guadalajara International Book Fair this coming week as I get time to digest the latest reports and sift through the fluff to find the details that matter.

##### Here just to say that as the event closed, total visitor numbers exceeded 815,000, so pretty much in line with expectations.

As reported here in late November, print book sales have slumped while ebook sales are on the rise.

However the Guadalajara numbers, as with book fair numbers across Latin America, show a healthy interest in books.regardless of what the mainstream retail numbers suggest.

Just a week or two ago FILIJ, the Mexican children's and YA book fair recorded over half a million visitors, and records have been broken across the region. FILVEN (the International Book Fair of Venezuela) setting a new record with 643,00 visitors. Earlier this year FIL La Paz (Peru) clocked 565,000 visitors and FIL Bogota clocked 575,000 visitors.
